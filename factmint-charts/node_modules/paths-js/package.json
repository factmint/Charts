  "readme": "Paths.js\n========\n\nPaths.js is a library to generate [SVG paths](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html), allowing you to create your own charts using a functional and testable API. It provides the primitives to create various shapes and charts starting from raw data, but it does not prescribe how you render these charts. This means you can use Paths.js to build components for your favorite frontend framework, and works even server-side on [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/).\n\nPaths.js offers three APIs, of increasing abstraction. The lowest level is a chainable API to generate an arbitrary SVG path. On top of this, paths for simple geometric shapes such as polygons or circle sectors are defined. At the highest level, there is an API to generate some simple graphs (pie, line chart, radar...) for a collection of data, assembling the simple shapes.\n\nTable of contents\n-----------------\n\n- [Let me see it](#let-me-see-it)\n- [Philosophy](#philosophy)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Resources](#resources)\n- [Browser support](#browser-support)\n- [Using Paths.js with the Canvas API](#using-pathsjs-with-the-canvas-api)\n- [Using Paths.js with Scala.js](#using-pathsjs-with-scalajs)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n\nLet me see it\n-------------\n\nOf course, when judging a chart library, this is a very reasonable request. But Paths.js is different: it provides the components, and you draw the charts. That said, there is a [demo application](http://andreaferretti.github.io/paths-js-demo/) to show some features - [here](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js-demo) you find the source.\n\nAnother demo, using Facebook React instead of Ractive.js, is in progress [here](http://andreaferretti.github.io/paths-js-react-demo/) ([source here](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js-react-demo)).\n\nPhilosophy\n----------\n\nDrawing beautiful charts is a craft, and often one needs to add custom interactions, styling or animations. There are some beautiful chart libraries out there, such as [Flotcharts](http://www.flotcharts.org/) or [Dimple](http://dimplejs.org/), and if those are enough for your needs, they can be a pleasure to use.\n\nIn many cases, though, what I really wanted was a library to take care of the generation of the chart, while still leaving me the possibility to render the actual thing. Paths.s does exactly this. It eventually generates [SVG paths](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html) with a high level API. These paths can be then used together with a template engine such as [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) or [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) to display SVG graphics in the browser. If instead of a static template engine, you use a data binding library, such as [Facebook React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/) or [Angular](http://angularjs.org/), you get animated graphics for free.\n\nIn designing Paths.js, I have tried to follow a few principles:\n\n* paths should be immutable\n* all exposed methods should be pure\n* from this follows that it is trivial to test components\n* and that they work on Node.js as well\n* it should be easy to integrate Paths.js into various frameworks\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nA detailed documentation is available on the [wiki](). Here are links to the main entry points.\n\nPaths.js offers three APIs, of increasing abstraction. The lowest level is a chainable API to generate an arbitrary SVG path. On top of this, paths for simple geometric shapes such as polygons or circle sectors are defined. At the highest level, there is an API to generate some simple graphs (pie, line chart, radar...) for a collection of data, assembling the simple shapes.\n\n- [Installation and usage](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js/wiki)\n- [Low level API](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js/wiki/Low%20level%20API)\n- [Mid level API (shapes)](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js/wiki/Mid-level-API)\n- [High level API (graphs)](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js/wiki/High-level-API)\n- [Miscellaneous](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js/wiki/Miscellaneous)\n\nThose users who prefer explicit typed interfaces can [browse the API](http://andreaferretti.github.io/paths-scala-js) of the Scala.js bindings.\n\nResources\n---------\n\nThese resources give a more detailed exposition of the philosophy behind Paths.js:\n\n* [Reactive SVG charts with Ractive.js and Paths.js](http://mlarocca.github.io/01-22-2014/pathsjs_ractive.html) by Marcello La Rocca\n* [My talk at MilanoJS user group](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-talk-slides), together with the [examples](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-talk-examples)\n* [Reactive SVG charts with Ractive.js](http://mlarocca.github.io/graphicalweb2014/)\n* [Visualization is for Sharing: Using React for Portable Data Visualization](http://viget.com/extend/visualization-is-for-sharing-using-react-for-portable-data-visualization) by Nate Hunzaker\n* [How to Create Performant, Template-based Charts with Paths.js](http://www.sitepoint.com/create-performant-template-based-charts-paths-js/)\n\nBrowser support\n---------------\n\nPaths.js works in any environment that supports a modern version of Javascript, namely ES5. This includes any version of Node.js and all recent browsers. If you need support for older browsers, you can include an [ES5 polyfill](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/).\n\nOn the other hand, not every browser will be able to display the SVG graphics that you will generate. Usually, recent desktop browsers are ok, but mobile browser are slow in adopting the SVG specification. You can refer to [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#search=svg) for more detailed information.\n\nUsing Paths.js with the Canvas API\n----------------------------------\n\nPaths.js does not directly support the [canvas element](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element), essentially because there is no need to do so. The [canvg](https://github.com/gabelerner/canvg) project allows to draw SVG paths on a `<canvas>` element, and it seems that canvas [will be able](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2012Mar/0269.html) to support SVG paths natively. Of course, canvas-based solutions limit the possibilities offered by data binding libraries for interaction, but they could be used as a fallback on less recent browsers.\n\nUsing Paths.js with Scala.js\n----------------------------\n\nIt is possible to use Paths.js with [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) - [this library](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-scala-js) defines the bindings.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nContributions to Paths.js are always welcome!
